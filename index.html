    <h1> Welcome!!</h1>
    <p>
        Welome to my static website that I will be evolving as I add projects to my repository on GitHub.
        I will keep this updated with links to each project or you can also just explore my Github if 
        you so choose. I have a love for coding and find it fancinating all the different ways to
        implement something. I always try to keep code as simple as possible, while having the most
        functionality that a particular piece of code should have. I don't focus on just the "what" and
        "how", I focus on the "why". It is my belief if someone figures out the "why" of something then
        the other stuff starts to fall into place. This also keeps my coding flexible, for example if
        the average engineer might write everything in OOP style, I might see that a part could just as 
        easily be implimented as a procedural function and would be faster for it, then I will go with the 
        procedural style for that part.
        I hope you enjoy growing with me and consider me as a potential candidate for your team.
