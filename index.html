								<!-- How I work -->
									<section>
										<h2>Programming Philosophy</h2>
										<p>
											Function before simplicity and simplicity before beauty. Now this 
											doesn't mean I don't use all three aspects, it is simply my workflow. 
											Secondly I also like to stay flexible with what language to use and when. 
											I learn quickly why a language functions the way it does, then the what 
											and how of a language falls into place. I research a project to find all 
											available possible documentation to add to my pallet of tools to work 
											from. Knowledge is power and this is especially true in programming.
										</p>

								<!-- fit into the team -->
									<section>
										<h2>What Languages does your team need?</h2>
										<p>
											In addition to having extensive knowledge of these languages I am also able to incorporate other languages as needed/desired. A combination of 
											languages is usually what makes the coding machine run at it's best. I 
											absorb programming language and styles like a sponge and am as malleable 
											enough to adjust to a team's needs.

									<section>
										<h2>My Projects?</h2>
										<p>
											If you want to check my programming projects, then simply click on a tab 
											at the top of the screen. More projects will be added as time goes on. If 
											by chance you don't see something that quite fits what you are looking for 
											just send me a message describing what you are wanting to see and I will 
											craft a rudimentary code snippet for you to examine. Go ahead and throw 
											me a curve ball if you want and I will do my best.
